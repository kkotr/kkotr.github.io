		<h2>A Brief History of Okinawa and Shito Ryu Karate</h2>
		<p>
			The Ryukyu Islands are located approximately 350 miles south of Japan. The largest of these islands is Okinawa, where immigrating Chinese introduced their fighting systems. Okinawa masters traveled to China to train for many years before returning to share their knowledge.<br>

			The exact dating of historical events is not possible primarily due to the secrecy surrounding the art. It is believed the refinement of the art developed in the 1600’s when Japan conquered the island and banned all forms of fighting. Karate continued its development in secrecy.<br>

			Gichin Funakoshi introduced karate to the modern world in 1922 when he took karate to Japan. Later karate was brought to the United States around 1955 by Mas Oyama.<br>

			Shito Ryu style of karate was founded by Kenwa Mabuni and the lineage continues on down through Siyogo Kuniba, Richard Baillargeon, Bobby Fischer, Jim Stewart, Brian Stewart, and Shon Barnes.<br>
