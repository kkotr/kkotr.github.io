			<h2>Karate My Hobby</h2>
			<p>This project will be a public bulletin board of the events and practices of karate, more specificlly of the dojo I am apart of. As well, be a basic guide for those individuals wanting to earn a black belt in karate. Like most sites there will be a history page, as well as images of what we do, definitions of key words, and a calander which will inform students, parents, and potentioal clients of when class are held and the topics covered in each of those classes.</p>
			<p>The five pages would be:</p>
			<ul><li><b>Home page:</b> Will contain a calender of what will be covered at the dojo's practices each month. and will have a json for the special events.</li>
			<li><b>Images:</b> Posted images or picture of special events, of student advances in karate, or of the class during practice.</li>
			<li><b>Dictionary:</b> Will be a list of key terms and phrases used during class, or which are important to know for other various reason. All this information will come from a json.</li>
			<li><b>Katas:</b> This page will have a number of various katas required for advancing in belt rank.</li>
			<li><b>History:</b> This page will contain the history of the dojo, as well as the history of our particlar style of karate.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p>Primary audience is adults ages 25-40.  Most will be parents. Access to the site will be split between mobile devices and laptops.</p>
			<h3>Audience Goals:</h3>
