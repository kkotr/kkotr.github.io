												<h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

												<h2>Introduction</h2>
												<!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
									<p>Spend one day (24 hours) using only the internet browser (not a dedicated app, use the browser) on my smart phone as you do your normal web browsing. </p>

												<h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
												<ul>
																<li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
																<li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
																<li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
																<li>Any frustrations?</li>
																<li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
												</ul>

												<h2>Findings</h2>
												<!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
												<h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
												<p>Yes, ebay made it easy to see what you were looking at.</p>
												<h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
												<p>No, Newegg made it difficult to browse through everything all you got to see in each tab was there feature specials. </p>
												<h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
												<p>Not really, Newegg made it feel like they only wanted you there if you knew what you wanted exactly. </p>
												<h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
												<p>Yes, I found it hard to go back a page on Walmart's website after looking at the picture if full screen. Sometimes it would give you a different page and it was hard to find the product that you just looked at. </p>
												<h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
												<p>Ebay's screen didn't feel as clustered to me as when I normally see it on a desktop.</p>
												<h2>Summary</h2>
												<p>I feel like most sites are trying to use/push browsing on a phone, but that they want you to use thier app. not the web.</p>

												<h2>List of sites</h2>
												<!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
												<ul>
																<li><a href="http://walmart.com" target="_blank">Walmart</a></li>
													<li><a href="http://newegg.com" target="_blank">Newegg</a></li>
													<li><a href="http://ebay.com" target="_blank">
