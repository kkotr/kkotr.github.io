		<p>"When God had made the earth and sky,<br>
		The flowers and the trees,<br>
		 He then made all the animals,<br>
		 The fish, the birds and bees.
		 </p>
		<p> And when at last He'd finished,<br>
		 Not one was quite the same,<br>
		 God said, "I'll walk this earth of mine,<br>
	 And give each one a name."</p>

		<p> And so He traveled far and wide,<br>
		 And everywhere He went,<br>
		 A little creature followed Him,<br>
	 Until its strength was spent.</p>

		<p> When all were named upon the earth,<br>
		 And in the sky and sea,<br>
		 The little creature said, "Dear Lord,<br>
	 There's not one left for me."</p>

		<p> Kindly the Father said to him,<br>
		 "I've left you to the end,<br>
		 I've turned my own name back to front,<br>
		 And call you DOG, my friend."</p>
